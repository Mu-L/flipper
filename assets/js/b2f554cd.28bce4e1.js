With the ongoing migration of all our clients to\\nWebSockets, we have committed to providing an official documented SDK for\\nJavaScript clients. Without further ado, welcome\\n[js-flipper](https://www.npmjs.com/package/js-flipper)!\\n\\nIn this post we will:\\n\\n- See what `js-flipper` is\\n- Get acquainted with how to build a Flipper plugin for a React app\\n- Learn how Flipper talks to a mobile device\\n- Dive deeper into the message structure\\n- Glance at what it takes to support a new platform\\n\\n\x3c!--truncate--\x3e\\n\\n## What `js-flipper` is and why it matters\\n\\nFlipper supports native iOS, native Android apps and React Native apps out of\\nthe box. Now with `js-flipper`, Flipper also supports JavaScript apps. Any\\nJavaScript app, whether they run in your browser or on your Node.js server, can\\nnow connect to Flipper for a debugging session.\\n\\n`js-flipper` is a new NPM package that exposes a Flipper client to your\\nJavaScript apps. Any Flipper client, in its turn, is a set of abstractions that\\nlet your device connect and talk to Flipper. Long story short, `js-flipper`\\nallows you to easily write Flipper plugins for your web and Node.js apps.\\n\\n> [Here](https://fbflipper.com/docs/tutorial/javascript/) is how you can write\\n> your first simple plugin.\\n\\nWhy does it matter?\\n\\nIt\'s a huge deal for two reasons:\\n\\n1. Flipper at its core is just a device discovery service with a message bus.\\n   Its power comes from the plugins and the ecosystem.\\n2. It brings us one step closer to our goal of running Flipper everywhere. Bring\\n   Flipper to your microwave! On a serious note, more platforms -> bigger\\n   community -> more developers -> more plugins -> better Flipper for everyone.\\n\\nLet\'s take a quick look at the principal architecture of Flipper:\\n\\n![Flipper architecture](/img/flipper-arch.svg)\\n\\nHere is what happens there:\\n\\n1. Flipper constantly polls\\n   [ADB](https://developer.android.com/studio/command-line/adb) for available\\n   Android devices and [IDB](https://fbidb.io/) for available iOS devices.\\n2. If the device is running an app with an enabled Flipper client, the client\\n   tries to connect to Flipper on your laptop. It lets Flipper know that there\\n   is an app that it can talk to. Flipper and app chit-chat a bit negotiating\\n   the security and the list of supported plugins.\\n3. The developer picks one of the connected apps / devices. Say, it\'s the app.\\n4. The developer clicks one of the available plugins.\\n5. The plugin starts talking to the app on the device via the message bus\\n   exposed by Flipper. The plugin asks for necessary data from the app and shows\\n   it in a pretty UI.\\n\\nAt Meta, we have many active plugins, across a wide variety of devices, not just\\nphones, but also Quests, desktop applications, etc. At its core, Flipper is\\ndata-agnostic and connect data flows to plugin displays. All Flipper core (we\\ncall it Flipper Server) knows is what devices and Flipper-enabled apps are out\\nthere. I hope it gets us on the same page regarding why plugins (and plugin\\ndevelopers!) are crucial for Flipper.\\n\\nAnother important conclusion you could draw from the diagram is that the state\\nof Flipper plugins is ephemeral and lives in the UI.\\n\\n## How Flipper talks to a mobile device\\n\\nLet\'s dive a bit deeper into how exactly the device and Flipper talk. Flipper\\npulls device logs from ADB/IDB. For everything else, Flipper expects the app\\n(Flipper client inside of the app) to open a WebSocket connection to Flipper.\\n\\nThe algorithm looks like this:\\n\\n1. The app opens a WebSocket connection to Flipper.\\n2. They exchange certificates. Flipper connects to the app using ADB/IDB and\\n   writes a certificate to the app storage.\\n3. The app opens a secure WebSocket connection to Flipper using the certificate.\\n\\nWhy do we even bother with the certificate exchange process? One of the\\npotential attack vectors is that a developer could install a malicious app on\\nthe testing device. That app could spin up a WebSocket server and mask itself as\\nFlipper. However, unlike Flipper, the malicious app can\'t access the file\\nstorage of another app. As a result, it can\'t complete the certificate exchange\\nprocess.\\n\\nOn mobile devices certificate exchange is important, so that other apps on the\\nphone can\'t impersonate Flipper. For browser apps this isn\'t an issue as the\\nbrowser already makes sure a malicious page cannot act as Flipper server. For\\nplatforms like this, we use a simplified connection algorithm:\\n\\n1. The app opens a WebSocket connection to Flipper.\\n2. Bingo!\\n\\n`js-flipper` implements the second algorithm, without the certificate exchange.\\n\\n## Message protocol and structure\\n\\nOnce the final WebSocket connection is established, Flipper starts talking to\\nthe app:\\n\\n1. It sends `getPlugins` and `getBackgroundPlugins` messages to get a list of\\n   plugins supported by the app.\\n2. Flipper displays the available plugins to the developer.\\n3. Developer clicks on one of the plugins (enables a plugin).\\n4. Flipper loads the UI for the plugin. Let\'s settle on calling the part of the\\n   plugin \\"desktop plugin\\" and the device part of the plugin \\"client plugin\\".\\n5. Flipper sends `init` message to the app.\\n6. Client plugin `onConnect` code is executed. Read more about Client Plugin API\\n   [here](https://fbflipper.com/docs/extending/create-plugin/).\\n7. Whenever a \\"desktop plugin\\" needs some data from the device it sends an\\n   `execute` message to the \\"client plugin\\" on the device.\\n8. \\"Client plugin\\" replies with the data.\\n9. \\"Client plugin\\" might force the \\"desktop plugin\\" to do something as well by\\n   sending an `execute` message as well. However, it is rare. In the current\\n   implementation, the \\"client plugin\\" can never expect a reply back from the\\n   \\"desktop plugin\\". In other words, consider it as an event sink, not as a way\\n   to extract some data from the \\"desktop plugin\\".\\n10. When the plugin is deactivated a `deinit` message is sent to the \\"client\\n    plugin\\".\\n11. Client plugin `onDisconnect` code is executed.\\n\\n> The process above is for the insecure WebSocket connections we currently use\\n> in `js-flipper`. It is more complicated for secure WebSocket connections that\\n> require certificate exchange.\\n\\nFlipper expects each message to have the following structure:\\n\\n```ts\\nexport interface FlipperRequest {\\n  method: string; // \'getPlugins\' | \'getBackgroundPlugins\' | \'init\' | \'deinit\' | \'execute\' | \'isMethodSupported\'\\n  params?: {\\n    api: string; // Plugin ID (name)\\n    // These nested `method` and `params` could be anything.\\n    // You set them yourself as you see fit to support the data exchange between the \\"desktop plugin\\" and the \\"client plugin\\".\\n    // For example, for \'ReactNativeTicTacToe\' we support 2 methods: \'SetState\' and \'GetState\'.\\n    // We pass a game state with a \'SetState\' message. See https://fbflipper.com/docs/tutorial/javascript/#step-3-call-addplugin-to-add-your-plugin\\n    method: string;\\n    params?: unknown;\\n  };\\n}\\n```\\n\\nThe only exception is the response message the \\"client plugin\\" sends back when\\nthe data is requested.\\n\\n```ts\\nexport type FlipperResponse = {\\n  id: number;\\n  success?: object | string | number | boolean | null;\\n  error?: {\\n    message: string;\\n    stacktrace?: string;\\n    name?: string;\\n  };\\n};\\n```\\n\\n## Building a new client\\n\\nAt this point, you know what messages your client needs to support in a Flipper\\nclient:\\n\\n- `getPlugins`\\n- `getBackgroundPlugins`\\n- `init`\\n- `deinit`\\n- `execute`\\n\\nOne other message we did not mention before is `isMethodSupported`. Its job is\\nto reply back to a \\"desktop plugin\\" whether a \\"client plugin\\" supports one of\\nplugin messages (that nested `method` field). It\'s useful when you have a single\\n\\"desktop plugin\\" implementation, but different \\"client plugin\\" implementations.\\nFor example, some operations might not be supported on iOS, but are supported on\\nAndroid. Alternatively, it can address version differences between the plugin\\ninstalled on the device and the one loaded into Flipper.\\n\\nIf you want to build a proper Flipper client, you also need to provide an\\nabstraction for plugin developers. Consider matching\\n[what we have for existing clients](https://fbflipper.com/docs/extending/create-plugin/#flipperplugin).\\n\\nMost of the groundwork for handling connections and doing certificate exchange\\nis already done in our\\n[C++ engine](https://github.com/facebook/flipper/tree/main/xplat). Our iOS,\\nAndroid, React Native clients use it under the hood. `js-flipper` implements\\neverything from scratch using native browser APIs (for Node.js apps we\\n[require developers to provide a WebSocket implementation](https://github.com/facebook/flipper/tree/main/js/js-flipper#nodejs)).\\n\\nHere is a detailed document on how to\\n[implement a client](https://fbflipper.com/docs/extending/new-clients/). You\\nmight also want to check the source code of our existing clients:\\n\\n- [iOS](https://github.com/facebook/flipper/tree/main/iOS/FlipperKit)\\n- [Android](https://github.com/facebook/flipper/tree/main/android/src/main)\\n- [React Native](https://github.com/facebook/flipper/tree/main/react-native/react-native-flipper)\\n- [JavaScript](https://github.com/facebook/flipper/tree/main/js/js-flipper)\\n\\n## What\'s next?\\n\\nAs of now, we do not provide any default plugins you might be used to for\\n`js-flipper` (Layout, Logs, Navigation, Crash Reporter, and others). We hope\\nthis will change in the future with the help of ur beloved open-source\\ncommunity!\\n\\n_Call to action!_\\n\\nWe would like to encourage you to play with `js-flipper`. See how it fits your\\nuse-case and get back back to us with your feedback on\\n[GitHub](https://github.com/facebook/flipper/issues). If you find yourself\\nimplementing one of your favorite Flipper plugins for `js-flipper`, do not\\nhesitate and raise a PR!\\n\\nPlugins can be either generic or very application specific. Plugins can interact\\nwith Redux or MobX stores, read performance data or console logs from the\\nbrowser. At Meta, we also see a lot of plugins that are very application\\nspecific. For example, plugins that allow logging in as specific test users with\\na single click, reading the internal state of NewsFeed and interacting with it,\\nsimulating photos captured by a smartphone, etc. A Flipper plugin can be any\\nform of UI that is useful to speed up debugging and tasks on things you work on\\nfrequently!\\n\\n## P.S. Flipper needs you!\\n\\nFlipper is maintained by a small team at Meta, yet is serving over a hundred\\nplugins and dozens of different targets. Our team\'s goal is to support Flipper\\nas a plugin-based platform for which we maintain the infrastructure. We don\'t\\ntypically invest in individual plugins, but we do love plugin improvements. For\\nexample, the support for mocking network requests (on Android) was entirely\\ncontributed by the community (thanks\\n[James Harmon](https://github.com/bizzguy)!). As was Protobuf support (thanks\\n[Harold Martin](https://github.com/hbmartin)!).\\n\\nFor that reason, we\'ve marked many requests in the issue tracker as\\n[PR Welcome](https://github.com/facebook/flipper/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aopen+label%3A%22PR+welcome%22).\\nContributing changes should be as simple as cloning the\\n[repository](https://github.com/facebook/flipper) and running\\n`yarn && yarn start` in the `desktop/` folder.\\n\\nInvesting in debugging tools, both generic ones or just for specific apps, will\\nbenefit iteration speed. And we hope Flipper will make it as hassle free as\\npossible to create your debugging tools.

RSocket is a protocol that served us well for encrypted communication between Flipper and clients. However, especially in the React Native world, the dependencies it brings has been a continuous source of build issues with any new iOS update. We are now testing internally a version of Flipper that uses secured WebSocket connections instead. The resulting simplified dependency chain should prevent a lot of current and future build issues.\\n* **Introduce a headless Flipper version**. The Flipper team is currently investing in decoupling all network, OS and device interaction logic from the Flipper front end. This will make it possible to run Flipper as a headless service, and embed the UI in any web-based stack. By default Flipper will remain an Electron app, but this change introduces a lot of new possibilities: It will be possible to run Flipper headless on CI systems to collect data during test runs. It will be possible to embed the Flipper UI inside IDEs to reduce context switching. To achieve this, the Flipper code base will be split into many smaller packages.\\n* **Improve the Flipper marketplace**. We are working on an improved Flipper plugin marketplace, to help promote plugins, and create a better understanding of what plugins do, and how they are supported.\\n* **Create a reference WebSocket implementation**. For Native mobile apps and React Native, there are standard packages to register plugins and connect to the Flipper desktop application. Although several WebSocket implementations exist to do the same for web apps, we don\'t have a standardized SDK and example project for integrating web applications with Flipper. By changing this we\'ll hope to make it easy for front-end engineers to leverage Flipper.\\n* **Add support for React Native Windows**. \'nough said.\\n\\n## Flipper needs you!\\n\\nFlipper is maintained by a small team at Facebook, yet serving over a hundred plugins and dozens of different targets.
